<h1> Simple Calculator </h1>

<h2> What is a Calculator? </h2>

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will addition, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus and power. There are simple basic calculators, scientific calculators & special purpose calculators (financial calculators etc.). Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs.

<h2> History of Calculator </h2>

The importance of this helpful tool was known in the early times. At that time, early men use bones, pebbles and other objects to tally the calculations.But, it was very limited in nature. So, when the first mainframe computers came into existence. It was using vacuum tubes and transistors. That leads to stepping stones to develop an electronic calculator.Therefore, the first electronic calculator was launched by Casio computer company in 1957. followed by a series of models with compact technology. Some leading manufactures opted for this technology to cover this new market. Like Canon, Sony, Toshiba, Olivetti, etc.

<h2> What is my project </h2>
In this project named "Simple Calculator", i have created a basic calculator which performs 6 basic arithmetic operations like addition, subration, multiplication, division, modulus and power. I have switch case to perform the type of operation which the user wants to. This project can be further implemented for the high level requirements.

<h2> Advantages </h2>

* innovative

* user-friendly

* long lasting etc..

<h2> Advantages </h2>

 * Do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division, modulus and Power.
